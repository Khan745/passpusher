# Passpusher
This project is a password pusher tool. The main idea behind this is to share sensitive information on the internet. Passpusher creates a secret link that allows anyone to see secret information. You are able to set up maximum numbers of views, time to link expiration, and also encrypt secret information. All sensitive data are processed in your browser and no sensitive information is shared on the internet.

Use cases:
- share sensitive information
- create RSA keys
- encrypt/decrypt text

# How to run it
Just run command: `docker-compose up` and go to `http://localhost:3000`

# TODO:

2. Write tests
3. Change in memory storage to db
